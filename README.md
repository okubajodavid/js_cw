# JavaScript Fundamentals

## Question 1: JavaScript Syntax (Life Coding)

- Write a JavaScript statement that displays "Hello, World!" using console.log.

- Identifying Types: What data type will each of these variables have?

  ```javascript
  let a = 42;
  let b = "Hello";
  let c = true;
  let d = [1, 2, 3];
  let e = { name: "John" };
  ```

- Declare a variable using _var_, another using _let_, and a third using _const_.

## Question 2: Presentation Question

- What is JavaScript syntax? Explain the basic structure of a JavaScript program with examples of statements, expressions, and keywords/reserve words.

- What are JavaScript's primitive data types? Provide examples of each and explain when you would use them.

- Explain the differences between var, let, and const in JavaScript. When would you use each one?
